# paraexp
This repository contains data and Matlab/Octave code from the paper "ParaExp using Leapfrog as Integrator for High-Frequency Electromagnetic Simulations" to be published by Radio Science, 2017

* run "figures" in Octave/Matlab to generate the images from the paper
* run "leapfrog" to reproduce the results for the inductor example
* for other approximations of the matrix exponential, see https://bitbucket.org/expleja/ and https://github.com/higham/expmv.
